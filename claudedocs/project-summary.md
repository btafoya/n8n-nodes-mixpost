# Mixpost n8n Community Node - Project Summary

**Status**: ✅ Requirements Discovery Complete - Ready for Development
**Date**: 2025-10-24

---

## 📋 Discovery Process Complete

### Your Requirements (From Questionnaire)

#### Scope & Purpose
- **Target**: Team/agency solution for multi-client social media management
- **Priority Features**:
  - Post creation and scheduling
  - Media management and uploads
  - Social account administration

#### Technical Decisions
- **Architecture**: Single multi-operation node (resource dropdown)
- **Authentication**: Static personal access tokens
- **URL Configuration**: Flexible with default `/api/mixpost` path
- **MVP Scope**: Core operations only (Posts CRUD + basic Media + Auth)

#### User Experience Goals
- **Post Creation**: Both simple and advanced modes with complexity toggle
- **Scheduling**: All options (datetime picker, relative scheduling, bulk patterns)
- **Media Handling**: Both binary data input and URL download methods

#### Distribution Plan
- **Publishing**: Community distribution via npm (no official n8n verification)
- **Maintenance**: Active maintenance + community-driven contributions
- **Testing**: Production Mixpost instance with careful testing protocols

## 🎯 Key Recommendations Provided

### Implementation Style: Programmatic
**Rationale**: Your requirements for both simple/advanced modes, multiple scheduling options, and flexible media handling need the control that programmatic implementation provides. While the Mixpost API is straightforward RESTful (which favors declarative), the UX complexity drives the decision toward programmatic.

### Phased Development Strategy

**Phase 1: MVP (6 weeks)**
- Core Posts operations (Create, List, Get, Update, Delete, Publish)
- Basic Media operations (Upload, Download URL, List)
- Account listing (read-only)
- Simple mode with datetime scheduling
- Both media input methods

**Phase 2: Enhanced UX**
- Simple/Advanced mode toggle
- Platform-specific post versions
- Relative scheduling
- Bulk scheduling patterns

**Phase 3: Complete Coverage**
- Account management (Update/Delete)
- Tags resource (full CRUD)
- Advanced post operations (Duplicate, Bulk Delete)

**Phase 4: Future Features**
- Analytics (when Mixpost adds API endpoints)
- Webhooks/triggers
- Advanced automation features
