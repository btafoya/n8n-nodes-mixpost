2. ‚úÖ Install in n8n (npm link or copy files)
3. ‚úÖ Restart n8n
4. ‚úÖ Access n8n web interface
5. ‚úÖ Find and add Mixpost node
6. ‚úÖ Configure credentials
7. ‚úÖ Test operations

## üì¶ Step 1: Install the Node Module in n8n

Before you can use your Mixpost node, you need to install it in n8n. There are two methods:

### Method A: Install via npm link (Development/Testing)

**Use this method for local testing before publishing to npm.**

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're in your project directory
cd /home/btafoya/projects/n8n-mixpost

# 2. Build the project
npm run build

# 3. Create a global npm link
npm link

# 4. Install in n8n
# For n8n installed globally:
cd $(npm root -g)/n8n
npm link n8n-nodes-mixpost

# OR if the above doesn't work:
cd ~/.n8n
mkdir -p nodes
cd nodes
npm link n8n-nodes-mixpost
```

### Method B: Install via npm (After Publishing)

**Use this method after you've published to npm.**

```bash
# Install using n8n's community nodes feature
n8n install n8n-nodes-mixpost

# OR manually in n8n's custom nodes directory:
cd ~/.n8n/nodes
npm install n8n-nodes-mixpost
```

### Method C: Manual Installation (Recommended for Development)

**‚úÖ Use this method if npm link has dependency conflicts (most reliable):**

```bash
# 1. Build the project
cd /home/btafoya/projects/n8n-mixpost
npm run build

# 2. Create n8n custom directory
mkdir -p ~/.n8n/custom

# 3. Copy built files to custom directory
cp -r dist/* ~/.n8n/custom/
cp package.json ~/.n8n/custom/

# Note: n8n loads custom nodes from ~/.n8n/custom by default
```

**Common Issue**: If you get npm dependency conflicts with `npm link`, use this method instead.

## üîÑ Step 2: Restart n8n

After installing the node, restart n8n:

```bash
# Stop n8n
pkill -f n8n

# Start n8n in background
nohup n8n start > n8n.log 2>&1 &

# Wait a few seconds for startup
sleep 5

# Verify it's running
ps aux | grep n8n | grep -v grep
```

---

## ‚úÖ n8n is Running Locally!

Your n8n instance is live at:
**http://localhost:5678**

---

## üîó Step 3: Access n8n

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5678
```

**First Time Setup**:
1. Create your n8n account (owner account)
2. Set up your username and password
3. You'll see the n8n workflow editor

---

## üîç Step 4: Find Your Mixpost Node

1. In the workflow editor, click **"Add node"** (the big + button)
2. Search for **"Mixpost"**
3. You should see the **Mixpost** node in the results!

**If you don't see it**: The node wasn't installed properly. Try:
1. Verify the build succeeded: `npm run build` (should have no errors)
2. Check if linked: `npm list -g n8n-nodes-mixpost`
3. Restart n8n: `pkill -f n8n && nohup n8n start > n8n.log 2>&1 &`
4. See troubleshooting section at the bottom of this guide

---

## üîê Step 5: Configure Mixpost Credentials

### Create Mixpost Credentials

1. Click on the Mixpost node
2. Click **"Create New Credential"** under Mixpost API
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Base URL**: Your Mixpost instance URL (e.g., `https://mixpost.example.com`)
   - **API Path**: `/api/mixpost` (leave default)
   - **Access Token**: Your Mixpost API token

### Get Your Mixpost Access Token

In your Mixpost instance:
1. Log in to Mixpost
2. Go to **Settings ‚Üí API Tokens**
3. Click **"Generate New Token"**
4. Copy the token
5. Paste it into n8n credentials

### Test Connection

1. Click **"Test"** button in credentials dialog
2. Should see: ‚úÖ **"Connection successful"**
3. Click **"Save"**

---

---

## üß™ Step 6: Test Operations

### Test 1: List Accounts (Safest - Read Only)

**This is the safest first test - it only reads data**

1. Add Mixpost node to workflow
2. Set **Resource**: `Account`
3. Set **Operation**: `List`
4. Click **"Execute node"**

**Expected Result**: JSON array of your connected social accounts
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "My Facebook Page",
    "platform": "facebook",
    "username": "mypage",
    ...
  }
]
```

---

### Test 2: List Media

1. Resource: `Media`
2. Operation: `List`
3. Execute

**Expected Result**: Your media library files

---

### Test 3: List Posts

1. Resource: `Posts`
2. Operation: `List`
3. (Optional) Add filters
4. Execute

**Expected Result**: Your Mixpost posts

---

### Test 4: Create Draft Post (Safe - Won't Publish)

**This creates a draft that won't be published to social media**

1. Resource: `Posts`
2. Operation: `Create`
3. **Content**: "Test post from n8n - this is a draft"
4. **Accounts**: Select one or more social accounts
5. **Additional Fields**:
   - Status: `Draft` (IMPORTANT!)
6. Execute

**Expected Result**: Post created in Mixpost as draft
- ‚úÖ Visible in Mixpost dashboard
- ‚úÖ Status: Draft
- ‚úÖ NOT published to social media

**Verify in Mixpost**: Check your Mixpost dashboard to see the draft post

---

### Test 5: Upload Media

**Requires binary data from a previous node**

Example workflow:
```
1. HTTP Request node:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: https://picsum.photos/400/300
   - Response Format: File

2. Mixpost node:
   - Resource: Media
   - Operation: Upload
   - Binary Property: data
   - Execute
```

**Expected Result**: Media uploaded to Mixpost library

---

### Test 6: Download Media from URL

1. Resource: `Media`
2. Operation: `Download from URL`
3. **URL**: `https://picsum.photos/400/300` (test image)
4. Execute

**Expected Result**: Media downloaded and added to Mixpost library

---

### Test 7: Update Post

1. Resource: `Posts`
2. Operation: `Update`
3. **Post ID**: (ID from a draft post)
4. **Update Fields**:
   - Content: "Updated content"
5. Execute

**Expected Result**: Post updated in Mixpost

---

### Test 8: Publish Post (Careful!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will actually publish to social media!**

Only test this with:
- A test social account (not production)
- OR a draft post you're ready to publish

1. Resource: `Posts`
2. Operation: `Publish`
3. **Post ID**: (ID of draft post to publish)
4. Execute

**Expected Result**: Post immediately published to selected social accounts

---

## üî¥ Production Testing Safety

### Before Testing on Production

**Create a Test Workspace in Mixpost**:
1. Use a dedicated test account
2. Connect test social media accounts (not client accounts!)
3. Always use `Draft` status initially
4. Document all test post IDs for cleanup

### Safety Checklist

- [ ] Using test Mixpost workspace, not production
- [ ] Connected to test social accounts only
- [ ] Creating drafts first (status: draft)
- [ ] Verified post IDs before deletion
- [ ] NOT selecting production client accounts
- [ ] Have cleanup plan for test posts

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Node Doesn't Appear in n8n

If you don't see the Mixpost node:

1. **Check if linked**:
```bash
cd /home/btafoya/projects/n8n-mixpost
npm link
```

2. **Restart n8n**:
```bash
# Stop current n8n instance
pkill -f n8n

# Start fresh
n8n start
```

3. **Verify build**:
```bash
npm run build
# Should complete without errors
```

### Credential Test Fails

**Possible causes**:

1. **Invalid Token**:
   - Generate new token in Mixpost
   - Copy entire token (no spaces)
   - Paste carefully into n8n

2. **Wrong Base URL**:
   - Include `https://` or `http://`
   - No trailing slash
   - Example: `https://mixpost.example.com`

3. **API Path Wrong**:
   - Default: `/api/mixpost`
   - Don't change unless using custom installation

4. **Mixpost Not Accessible**:
   - Test direct API call:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://your-mixpost.com/api/mixpost/accounts
```

### Operation Fails

**Check Error Message**:
- `401`: Invalid token ‚Üí regenerate token
- `404`: Wrong endpoint or ID doesn't exist
- `422`: Validation error ‚Üí check required fields
- `429`: Rate limit ‚Üí wait and retry
